The Learning objectives of this learning assigment are:


By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

    1. Explain what Git and GitHub are and the differences between the two.
    2. Describe the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping.
    3. Describe why Git is useful for an individual developer and a team of developers.
    
  1.Git is the open source software in the command line that handles the version control system and github is the sharing platform for respositories made public via Git and is a for profit software.
  
  2. Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that stores all of the snapshots a of project files. Whereas, a text editor only stores the changes in files for its version history. Git is much easier to work with in terms of speed and restoring any changes that may have been made throughout the lifecycle of the project. Git also allows for collaboration of multiple team members onto one file at one time. It will track all changes and allow for a merge to occur to accept the changes between the two collaborators.
  
  3. Git is useful for an inidividual developer because it provides the tools for one person to be able to try multiple things out in a project and revert back if any errors have been made.
  
  Git is also useful for a team of developers as it allows for multiple parallel working enviroments and for all of the team members to view the changes and history of the project.
